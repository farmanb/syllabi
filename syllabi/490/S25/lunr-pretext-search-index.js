I monitor my email during regular business hours and try to respond within one business day.    Official University Email Addresses  The University provides each student with an email address and all official course correspondence will only be conducted using official university email addresses.    Email Etiquette  When you send an email, your message should contain the following information   Subject  A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 490 - ???).    Salutation  A professional greeting such as Dear or Hello followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name (  Dr. X).   If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate ( a PhD ), then you should address the recipient as Dr. X, never Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. . X.    If you are unsure, Professor X is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.       Body  A concise message that clearly expresses the purpose of your email.    Signature  A simple closing (e.g. Sincerely,  Thank you,  Best regards,  ) followed by your first and last name.   For your convenience, included below is an example email.   Sample Email  Subject: Meeting - Math 490 - ???  Dear Dr. Farman,  I am having trouble with this week's homework. I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved. Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?  Thank you,  Jane Doe    "

  "body": " Course Information   Course Description  This course provides a hands on introduction to formal verification and computer assisted proof development using the Lean theorem prover. Bringing together students from both Mathematics and Computer Science, the course will show how to represent mathematical concepts in a precise formal language, construct and verify proofs interactively, and leverage automated techniques to eliminate logical errors. Along the way, you’ll explore core ideas from logic, type theory, and proof strategies, that can be applied to create robust formalizations of everything from classical theorems to complex software specifications.  Mathematics students will see how formalizing arguments in Lean can reveal hidden assumptions, refine logical thinking, and spark fresh insights even for well known theorems. Lean also serves as a platform for cutting edge mathematical research, with extensive libraries of verified results that encourage meaningful contributions. Computer Science students will discover how Lean’s type theoretic foundations apply to verifying algorithms, cryptographic protocols, and large scale software systems, reinforcing a correctness first mindset essential to modern development. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to produce fully machine checked proofs, apply formal methods to real world challenges, and collaborate effectively with mathematicians and software engineers alike—bridging the gap between theoretical vision and practical reliability.    Course Prerequisites    Student Learning Outcomes    Course Topics    Instructional Methods  This course is offered as a face-to-face course. Learning will be facilitated through traditional lecture, group work\/activities, homework, and in-class assessments.   "

The exams are scheduled as follows:      The instructor reserves the right to modify the schedule of in class exams.    The final exam date and time are scheduled in advanced. Failure to appear at the final exam will result in a grade of zero for the exam.        Homework  Homework will be assigned regularly. The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts from the standards. Mastery of these homework sets serves as a good indicator for performance on assessments. As such, you should ensure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text, a computer, or any other tools not available during an exam.    Weights  Grades will be calculated using the weights below.

  "body": " Course Policies and Procedures   At a minimum, all policies stated in the current Louisiana Tech University Student Handbook should be followed. Additional class policies follow.    Textbook    Attendance Policy  Per University Policy 2206 :    All students are expected to attend classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually. Failure to do so may jeopardize a student's scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the College or University.  The student is responsible for making arrangements satisfactory to the instructor regarding absences including prior notification of planned absences, providing documentation if needed, and making up of examinations and work as required. For other emergency absences, the student shall submit excuses for class absences to the appropriate instructor within three class days following the student's return to their respective class.    As noted above, students are obligated to complete all assigned work promptly, to attend class regularly, and to participate in whatever class discussion may occur. Any behavior that interferes with the ability of other students to learn is unacceptable. If any of these become an issue, you will be asked to leave class for the day.  Your phone should be on silent and put away during class. Headphones should also be put away during class. Texting and browsing social media during class is rude and disrespectful. Please refrain from using your phone during class unless explicitly stated otherwise. If you are caught with a cell phone on your desk, in your lap, or anywhere in view while taking a quiz or exam, it will be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. Smart watches are also prohibited during exams; please put them away during those times.    Late Policy  Late work will not be accepted. Students who cannot submit work due to a University-related activity requiring an absence from class must arrange for work to be submitted before leaving.    Make-up Policy  In the event of one missed exam due to absence, the Final Exam can be used to replace the missing exam. Further missed exams will result in a grade of zero. If a University sponsored activity requires you to miss an exam, you must complete the exam in advance.    Academic Honor Code  In accordance with the Academic Honor Code , students pledge the following:    Being a student of higher standards, I pledge to embody the principles of academic integrity.    Any suspected case of academic dishonesty will be reported. If it is determined that academic misconduct has occurred, the student will receive a grade of F for the course and may be dismised from the University.   "
