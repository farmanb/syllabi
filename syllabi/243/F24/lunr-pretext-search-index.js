I monitor my email during regular business hours and try to respond within one business day.    Official University Email Addresses  The University provides each student with an email address and all official course correspondence will only be conducted using official university email addresses.    Email Etiquette  When you send an email, your message should contain the following information   Subject  A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 243 - 004).    Salutation  A professional greeting such as Dear or Hello followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name (  Dr. X).   If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate ( a PhD ), then you should address the recipient as Dr. X, never Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. . X.    If you are unsure, Professor X is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.       Body  A concise message that clearly expresses the purpose of your email.    Signature  A simple closing (e.g. Sincerely,  Thank you,  Best regards,  ) followed by your first and last name.   For your convenience, included below is an example email.   Sample Email  Subject: Meeting - Math 243 - 004  Dear Dr. Farman,  I am having trouble with this week's homework. I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved. Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?  Thank you,  Jane Doe    "

  "body": " Course Policies and Procedures   At a minimum, all policies stated in the current Louisiana Tech University Student Handbook should be followed. Additional class policies follow.    Textbook   Required Textbook   Calculus: Early Transcendentals , Edition, by James Stewart, Daniel Clegg, Saleem Watson. ISBN : 1-337-61392-4.     Attendance Policy  Per University Policy 2206 :    All students are expected to attend classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually. Failure to do so may jeopardize a student's scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the College or University.  The student is responsible for making arrangements satisfactory to the instructor regarding absences including prior notification of planned absences, providing documentation if needed, and making up of examinations and work as required. For other emergency absences, the student shall submit excuses for class absences to the appropriate instructor within three class days following the student's return to their respective class.    As noted above, students are obligated to complete all assigned work promptly, to attend class regularly, and to participate in whatever class discussion may occur. Any behavior that interferes with the ability of other students to learn is unacceptable. If any of these become an issue, you will be asked to leave class for the day.  Your phone should be on silent and put away during class. Headphones should also be put away during class. Texting and browsing social media during class is rude and disrespectful. Please refrain from using your phone during class unless explicitly stated otherwise. If you are caught with a cell phone on your desk, in your lap, or anywhere in view while taking a quiz or exam, it will be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. Smart watches are also prohibited during exams; please put them away during those times.    Late Policy  Late work will not be accepted. Students who cannot submit work due to a University-related activity requiring an absence from class must arrange for work to be submitted before leaving.    Make-up Policy  In the event of one missed exam due to absence, the Final Exam can be used to replace the missing exam. Further missed exams will result in a grade of zero. If a University sponsored activity requires you to miss an exam, you must complete the exam in advance.    Academic Honor Code  In accordance with the Academic Honor Code , students pledge the following:    Being a student of higher standards, I pledge to embody the principles of academic integrity.    Any suspected case of academic dishonesty will be reported. If it is determined that academic misconduct has occurred, the student will receive a grade of F for the course and may be dismised from the University.   "
