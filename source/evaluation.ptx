  <introduction>
    <p component="MBT">
    This course will use <alert>Mastery Based Grading</alert>.
    The content is broken into <em>standards</em> that you are expected to master by the end of the course.
  </p>

  <p component="MBT">
    This grading system is <em>iterative</em> in the sense that you will have multiple opportunities to display mastery of each standard, and <em>forgetful</em> in the sense that your previous unsuccessful attempts are discarded once you demonstrate mastery of a standard.
  </p>
  
  <p component="MBG">
    Mastering a standard is a two-step process, consisting of mastering a Lesson and a written Assessment.
    Each week we will cover around 2 Lessons in Hawkes, followed by a written Assessment that is due by the end of the week.
  </p>
  
  <p component="MBT">
    You can find a list of each standard in <xref ref="standards"/>.
