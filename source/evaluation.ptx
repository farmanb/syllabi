  <title>Evaluation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p component="MBT">
    This course will use <alert>Mastery Based Grading</alert>.
    The content is broken into <em>standards</em> that you are expected to master by the end of the course.
  </p>

  <p component="MBT">
    This grading system is <em>iterative</em> in the sense that you will have multiple opportunities to display mastery of each standard, and <em>forgetful</em> in the sense that your previous unsuccessful attempts are discarded once you demonstrate mastery of a standard.
  </p>
  
  <p component="MBG">
    Mastering a standard is a two-step process, consisting of mastering a Lesson and a written Assessment.
    Each week we will cover around 2 Lessons in Hawkes, followed by a written Assessment that is due by the end of the week.
  </p>
  
  <p component="MBT">
    A description of each standard can be found in <xref ref="standards"/>.
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection component="MBT">
    <title>Assessments</title>
    <p>
      Each assessment will contain problems corresponding to one or more standards.
      The standards are graded <em>independently</em> and, unlike quizzes or tests that you may have had in the past, there is no partial credit.
      To master a standard, you must master <alert>all</alert> of the problems that go with the standard.

      <title>Homework</title>
      <p>
	You may resubmit <alert>one</alert> homework set that you have not mastered each week.
	When reassessing, you only need to correct and resubmit the exercises with mistakes.
      </p>

      <title>Assessment</title>
      <p>
	There are scheduled Reassessment days for this course (see <xref ref="schedule"/>) where you have the opportunity to reassess all of the standards that you have not yet mastered.
	You will be given an assessment that contains problems for <em>every</em> standard that you have not yet mastered, and you may attempt as many of those standards as time allows.
