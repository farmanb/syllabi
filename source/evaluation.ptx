      This course will use <alert>Standards Based Grading</alert>.
      The content is broken into <em>standards</em> that you are expected to master by the end of the course.
    </p>

    <p component="MBT">
      This grading system is <em>iterative</em> in the sense that you will have multiple opportunities to display mastery of each standard, and <em>forgetful</em> in the sense that your previous unsuccessful attempts are discarded once you demonstrate mastery of a standard.
    </p>
    
    <p component="MBG">
      Mastering a standard is a two-step process.
      You will need to earn a score of <alert>M</alert> on the Homework that goes with the standard <em>and</em> an in-class Assessment.
    </p>
    
    <p component="MBT">
      A description of each standard can be found in the <xref ref="standards" text="title"/> section.

    <title>Assessments</title>
    <p>
      This course will have in-class, written assessments.
      You may not use the text, your notes, or any devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each assessment will contain problems corresponding to one or more standards.
      The standards are scored <em>independently</em> using the scale in the <xref ref="scoring" text="title"/> section.
      To master a standard, you must earn a score of <alert>M</alert> on <alert>all</alert> of the problems that go with the standard.
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Reassessment</title>
      <p>
	There are scheduled Reassessment days for this course (see the <xref ref="schedule" text="title"/>) where you will be given problems for <em>every</em> standard that you have <em>not yet mastered</em>.
	You may attempt as many standards as time allows.

    <title>Homework</title>
    <p component="S25">
      Homework assignments are a critical component of the course.

      Assignments will include a mix of logical proofs, programming tasks, and conceptual exercises.
      Solutions must be submitted on time and will be graded for clarity and correctness.
      Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must submit their own work.

    <title>Projects</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
	Projects are a significant component of the course, giving students the opportunity to apply their knowledge to formalize and verify mathematical or computational concepts in Lean.
	These projects will build problem-solving skills, encourage creativity, and allow students to explore the potential of interactive theorem proving.
	Both the midterm and final projects will be evaluated based on technical accuracy, clarity of exposition, creativity, and teamwork.
      </p>

      <p component="graduate">
	These projects provide graduate students the opportunity to develop independent research and leadership skills.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsubsection>
      <title>Midterm Project</title>
      <p>
	Students will work in small groups to formalize a specific problem or proof in Lean.
	The midterm project will focus on a foundational topic, with structured guidance provided to ensure students develop proficiency in key skills.
	<!-- Students will work in small groups to formalize a specific problem or proof in Lean, with clear deliverables and evaluation criteria. -->
      </p>

      <p component="graduate">
	Graduate students will take responsibility for guiding a group through each stage of the process.
	This includes helping the team evaluate the provided problems, select one to work on, and translate it intro Lean code.
	Graduate students will organize the development of the proof, ensuring all necessary definitions, lemmas, and arguments are included.
	They will provide technical guidance, troubleshoot challenges, and ensure that all group members contribute equitably.
	Additionally, they are responsible for managing milestones and ensuring the submission of a polished, well-documented Lean file.
	<!-- This leadership role allows graduate students to develop mentoring and problem-solving skills while fostering a collaborative and successful team environment. -->
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection component="graduate">
      <title>Final Project Topic Proposal and Selection</title>
      <p>
	Graduate students are responsible for researching and proposing a final project topic, which must involve advanced applications of interactive theorem proving.
	The proposal should outline a relevant, feasible, and impactful project topic, incorporating instructor feedback to refine ideas.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Final Project</title>
      <p>
	The final project will allow students to choose from a list of complex problems that align with their interests and demonstrates their mastery of course material.
	Projects will require students to design and implement creative solutions, formalize their work in Lean, and present their work to the class.
	<!-- Graduate students will lead undergraduate teams for the projects, taking on additional responsibilities such as mentoring, coordinating efforts, and ensuring project milestones are met.  -->
      </p>

      <p component="graduate">
	Graduate students will be responsible for assembling a team to executing the project, ensuring collaboration and effective contributions from all members.
