      <p>Dear Professor Farman,</p>
      
      <p>
	I am having trouble with this week's homework.
	I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved.
	Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?
      </p>

      <p>Thank you,</p>
