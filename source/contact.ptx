    <title>Email Etiquette</title>
    <p>
      When you send an email, your message should contain the following information
      <dl>
	<li>
	  <title>Subject</title>
	  <p component="63057">
	    A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 1011 - 63057).
	  </p>
	  <p component="63167">
	    A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 1011 - 63167).
	  </p>
	  <p component="63789">
	    A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 1031 - 63789).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <title>Salutation</title>
	  <p>
	    A professional greeting such as <q>Dear</q> or <q>Hello</q> followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate (<eg/> a <abbr>Ph.D.</abbr>), then you should address the recipient as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <angles>Last Name</angles>, not
		<abbr>Mr.</abbr>, <abbr>Ms.</abbr>, or <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> <angles>Last Name</angles>.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		If you are unsure, Professor <angles>Last Name</angles> is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <title>Body</title>

      <p>Dear <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Farman,</p>
      
      <p>
	I am having trouble with this week's homework.
	I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved.
	Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?
      </p>

      <p>Thank you,</p>
