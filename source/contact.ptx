	  <p>
	    A professional greeting such as <q>Dear</q> or <q>Hello</q> followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name (<eg/> <abbr>Dr.</abbr> X).
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate (<eg/> a <abbr>PhD</abbr>), then you should address the recipient as <abbr>Dr.</abbr> X, never
		  <abbr>Mr.</abbr> X, <abbr>Ms.</abbr> X, or <abbr>Mrs.</abbr>. X.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>
		  If you are unsure, Professor X is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.
		</p>

      <p>Dear <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Farman,</p>

      <p>
	I am having trouble with this week's homework.
	I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved.
	Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?
      </p>

      <p>Thank you,</p>
