  <title>Student Learning Outcomes</title>

  <p component="308">
    The student will demonstrate proficiency the ideas and techniques of Linear Algebra by performing adequately on a series of exams and homework exercises.
  </p>
  
  <p component="243">
    The student will become proficient in vectors and the geometry of space, vector functions, and multiple integration.
    This proficiency will be demonstrated by satisfactorily completing a series of exams and homework assignments.
  </p>

    <p component="S25">
    Mathematics students will see how formalizing arguments in Lean can reveal hidden assumptions, refine logical thinking, and spark fresh insights, even for well<ndash/>known theorems.
    Lean also serves as a platform for cutting<ndash/>edge mathematical research, with extensive libraries of verified results that encourage meaningful contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer Science students will discover how Leanâ€™s type<ndash/>theoretic foundations apply to verifying algorithms, cryptographic protocols, and large<ndash/>scale software systems, reinforcing a correctness<ndash/>first mindset essential to modern development.
    By the end of the course, you will be prepared to produce fully machine<ndash/>checked proofs, apply formal methods to real<ndash/>world challenges, and collaborate effectively with mathematicians and software engineers alike, bridging the gap between theoretical vision and practical reliability.
