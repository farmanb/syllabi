  <title>Course Description</title>

  <p component="S25">
    This course provides a hands<ndash/>on introduction to formal verification and computer<ndash/>assisted proof development using the Lean theorem prover.
    Bringing together students from both Mathematics and Computer Science, the course will show how to represent mathematical concepts in a precise formal language, construct and verify proofs interactively, and leverage automated techniques to eliminate logical errors.
    Along the way, youâ€™ll explore core ideas from logic, type theory, and proof strategies, that can be applied to create robust formalizations of everything from classical theorems to complex software specifications.
