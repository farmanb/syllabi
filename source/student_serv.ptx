    <title>Disability Accommodations</title>
    <p>
      The University of Louisiana at Monroe strives to serve students with special needs through compliance with Sections 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. These laws mandate that postsecondary institutions provide equal access to programs and services for students with disabilities without creating changes to the essential elements of the curriculum. While students with special needs are expected to meet our institution's academic standards, they are given the opportunity to fulfill learner outcomes in alternative ways. Examples of accommodations may include, but are not limited to, testing accommodations (oral testing, extended time for exams), interpreters, relocation of inaccessible classrooms, permission to audiotape lectures, note-taking assistance, and course substitutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current policies on serving students with disabilities can be obtained from the ULM website: <url href="http://ulm.edu/counselingcenter/"/>.
      If you need accommodation because of a known or suspected disability, you should contact the director for disabled student services at:

    <title>FERPA</title>
    <p>
      Do not email or call your professor regarding your course grades.
      The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits your professor from discussing your grade in any manner except in person.
      Please do not have family members, friends, or anyone else contact your professor about your grade as FERPA prohibits your professor from sharing that information with them.
