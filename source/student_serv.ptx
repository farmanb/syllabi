    <title>Disability Accommodations</title>
    <p>
      In order to create an inclusive learning environment, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations.
      Requests for academic accommodations should be made during the first week of the quarter, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made.
      Please see <url href="www.latech.edu/ods"/> for more information.

    <title>Emergency Notification System</title>
    <p>
      All Louisiana Tech students are strongly encouraged to enroll and update their contact information in the Emergency Notification System (<init>ENS</init>).
      It takes just a few seconds to ensure youâ€™re able to receive important text and voice alerts in the event of a campus emergency.
      For more information visit <url href="https://www.latech.edu/current-students/student-advancement-affairs/university-police/emergency-notification-system/"/>.
