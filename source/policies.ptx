  <title>Attendance Policy</title>
  <p>
    Students are expected to adhere to the Class Attendance Policy outlined in the ULM Student Policy Manual.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
	Class attendance is regarded as an obligation and a privilege, and all students are expected to attend all required classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually.
	Failure to do so may jeopardize a student’s scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the University.
	<alert>Students are responsible for the effect absences have on all forms of evaluating course performance.</alert>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	In accordance with University policy, the instructor will take roll regularly.
	It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that his/her attendance is recorded.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Each student is responsible for all class material and assignments whether or not the student is present.
	If a student misses class, then he/she is expected to check Moodle and ULM email for announcements and work on the assignments listed in Hawkes Learning.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	A student accumulating absences of 25% of the class meetings regardless of the reasons (excused or unexcused) will be reported to the Dean of Arts, Education, &amp; Sciences which could result in academic withdrawal from the course or a course grade of F.
	This may be avoided if the course is dropped; however, it is the responsibility of the student to drop the course.
	Class removal carries with it the penalties of being assigned a grade of W or F, whichever is appropriate, and no credit for the course.
	Academic withdrawal may negatively impact a student’s full-time status.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	University Excuses:  Any University-related activity requiring an absence from class will count as an absence when determining if a student has met the minimum attendance requirement.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Only students registered in MATH 1007 may attend the lectures.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Only students registered in mathematics courses may enter the Math Resource Center (MRC).
      </p>

  <title>Academic Integrity</title>
  <p>
    Faculty and students must observe the ULM published policy on Academic Dishonesty (see the ULM Student Policy Manual -- \url{http://www.ulm.edu/studentpolicy/}).\\
    Any student caught turning in work that is not his/her own will be reported to the School of Sciences.
    If the student is found to be responsible for such a violation, then a formal report will be made to the Office of Student Services and the student will receive \textbf{a grade of F for the course}.
