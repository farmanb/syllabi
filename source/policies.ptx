  <title>Attendance Policy</title>
  <p>
    Per <url href="https://www.latech.edu/administration/policies/p-2206/" visual="">University Policy 2206</url>:
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
      All students are expected to attend classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually.
      Failure to do so may jeopardize a student's scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the College or University.
    </p>
    <p>
      The student is responsible for making arrangements satisfactory to the instructor regarding absences including prior notification of planned absences, providing documentation if needed, and making up of examinations and work as required.
      For other emergency absences, the student shall submit excuses for class absences to the appropriate instructor within three class days following the student's return to their respective class.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
  </assemblage>

  <p>
    As noted above, students are obligated to complete all assigned work promptly, to attend class regularly, and to participate in whatever class discussion may occur.
    Any behavior that interferes with the ability of other students to learn is unacceptable.
    If any of these become an issue, you will be asked to leave class for the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your phone should be on silent and put away during class.
    Headphones should also be put away during class.
    Texting and browsing social media during class is rude and disrespectful.
    Please refrain from using your phone during class unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    If you are caught with a cell phone on your desk, in your lap, or anywhere in view while taking a quiz or exam, it will be treated as a case of academic dishonesty.
    Smart watches are also prohibited during exams; please put them away during those times.
  </p>

  <title>Make-up Policy</title>
  <p component="WAG">

  </p>
  
  <p component="MBT">
    In the event of a missed assessment due to absence, students will be given the opportunity to attempt all missed standards on the next reassessment.
