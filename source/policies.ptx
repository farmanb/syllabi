  <!--   Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, ULM has followed the guidance of the CDC and the ULS System regarding what measures to put in place at various stages of the outbreak. -->
  <!--   This situation is unchanged in the coming semester, as the CDC guidance on the need for social distancing, mask wearing, and vaccinations will be followed as the outbreak continues to evolve. -->
  <!--   Therefore, please continue to monitor university e-mails and websites (\url{https://www.ulm.edu/coronavirus/}) for any new updates on the pandemic. -->

  <title>Attendance Policy</title>
  <p>
    Students are expected to adhere to the Class Attendance Policy outlined in the ULM Student Policy Manual.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
	Class attendance is regarded as an obligation and a privilege, and all students are expected to attend all required classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually.
	Failure to do so may jeopardize a student’s scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the University.
	<alert>Students are responsible for the effect absences have on all forms of evaluating course performance.</alert>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	In accordance with University policy, the instructor will take roll regularly.
	It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that his/her attendance is recorded.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	Each student is solely responsible for all class material and assignments whether or not the student is present.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	A student accumulating absences of 25% of the class meetings regardless of the reasons (excused or unexcused) will be reported to the Dean of Arts, Education, &amp; Sciences which could result in academic withdrawal from the course or a course grade of F.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>This may be avoided if the course is dropped; however, it is the responsibility of the student to drop the course.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p> Class removal carries with it the penalties of being assigned a grade of W or F, whichever is appropriate, and no credit for the course.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>Academic withdrawal may negatively impact a student’s full-time status.</p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
	University Excuses:  Any University-related activity requiring an absence from class will count as an absence when determining if a student has met the minimum attendance requirement.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p component="1007">
	Only students registered in MATH 1007 may attend the lectures.

    Any student caught turning in work that is not his/her own will be reported to the School of Sciences.
