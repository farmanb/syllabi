  <title>Temporary Remote Instruction (TRI)</title>
  <p>
    During the semester, class and/or campus operations might be disrupted by an occurrence such as a tornado, fire, or illness outbreak that temporarily prevents in-person instruction.
    Until in-person instruction is possible, the class will enter a phase of temporary remote instruction (TRI).
    During this phase, instruction will take place via virtual means, either synchronously or asynchronously.
    Your instructor will alert you when this happens via e-mail and will include a description of how the course will proceed.  
  </p>
  <p>
    During a period of temporary remote instruction, the need for the course to continue in a virtual manner means that you will be required to have appropriate equipment, software, and telecommunication access to allow you to participate.
